In this report, data from ten different European countries were collected for a period
of 10 years from (2010 to 2019). This is then used to generate an energy consumption
dashboard and tell three different stories such as total energy units consumed by each
of the ten countries, a breakdown of sector energy consumption by each country and
comparing the various sectorâ€™s energy consumption of the ten countries from 2010 to
2019.
